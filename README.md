# SPAM-EMAIL-DETECTION-MODEL USING LOGISTIC MODEL
ðŸ“Œ Project: Spam Email Detection Model 
ðŸ”¹ Description

This project implements a Spam Email Detection system using Logistic Regression. The model classifies emails into Spam or Not Spam (Ham) by analyzing the text content. The project demonstrates text preprocessing, feature extraction with TF-IDF, and supervised learning for binary classification.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Preprocessing of raw email text (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)

Feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorization

Logistic Regression model for binary classification

Evaluation with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix

Prediction function for classifying new/unseen emails

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, TF-IDF, evaluation metrics)

NLTK / re (regex) for preprocessing

Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization

ðŸ”¹ Use Case

This project can be used as a lightweight spam filter for emails or messages, serving as a foundation for more advanced NLP and cybersecurity applications.
